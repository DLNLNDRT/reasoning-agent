1. **WHITE DWARF STAR**: TYPE IA SUPERNOVAE OCCUR IN BINARY STAR SYSTEMS WHERE ONE OF THE STARS IS A WHITE DWARF. THE WHITE DWARF IS TYPICALLY THE REMNANT OF A STAR THAT HAS EXHAUSTED ITS NUCLEAR FUEL.

2. **ACCRETION OF MATERIAL**: THE WHITE DWARF ACCUMULATES MATTER FROM A COMPANION STAR, WHICH CAN BE A MAIN-SEQUENCE STAR, A RED GIANT, OR ANOTHER WHITE DWARF. THIS PROCESS IS KNOWN AS ACCRETION.

3. **CHANDRASEKHAR LIMIT**: WHEN THE MASS OF THE WHITE DWARF APPROACHES THE CHANDRASEKHAR LIMIT (APPROXIMATELY 1.4 SOLAR MASSES), THE PRESSURE AND TEMPERATURE IN THE CORE BECOME SUFFICIENT TO IGNITE CARBON FUSION.

4. **THERMONUCLEAR EXPLOSION**: THE IGNITION OF CARBON FUSION LEADS TO A RUNAWAY THERMONUCLEAR REACTION, RESULTING IN A CATASTROPHIC EXPLOSION THAT COMPLETELY DISRUPTS THE WHITE DWARF.

5. **LUMINOUS AND CONSISTENT BRIGHTNESS**: TYPE IA SUPERNOVAE ARE KNOWN FOR THEIR CONSISTENT PEAK LUMINOSITY, WHICH MAKES THEM USEFUL AS STANDARD CANDLES FOR MEASURING ASTRONOMICAL DISTANCES. THEIR BRIGHTNESS CAN BE CALIBRATED TO DETERMINE DISTANCES TO FAR-OFF GALAXIES.

6. **NO HYDROGEN LINES**: UNLIKE TYPE II SUPERNOVAE, TYPE IA SUPERNOVAE DO NOT SHOW HYDROGEN LINES IN THEIR SPECTRA. INSTEAD, THEY PRIMARILY EXHIBIT LINES FROM ELEMENTS LIKE SILICON AND IRON.

7. **REMNANTS**: THE EXPLOSION DISPERSES THE OUTER LAYERS OF THE WHITE DWARF INTO SPACE, ENRICHING THE INTERSTELLAR MEDIUM WITH HEAVY ELEMENTS SUCH AS IRON, WHICH ARE PRODUCED DURING THE EXPLOSION.

8. **RATE OF OCCURRENCE**: TYPE IA SUPERNOVAE ARE RELATIVELY COMMON IN THE UNIVERSE AND ARE THOUGHT TO ACCOUNT FOR ABOUT 30% OF ALL SUPERNOVAE OBSERVED.

* **THEY ARE INCREDIBLY BRIGHT:**  TYPE IA SUPERNOVAE ARE AMONG THE MOST LUMINOUS EXPLOSIONS IN THE UNIVERSE. THIS MAKES THEM USEFUL AS ""STANDARD CANDLES"" FOR MEASURING COSMIC DISTANCES.

* **THEY INVOLVE A WHITE DWARF STAR:** THE PROGENITOR OF A TYPE IA SUPERNOVA IS A WHITE DWARF STAR, WHICH HAS EXHAUSTED ITS NUCLEAR FUEL AND IS NO LONGER PRODUCING ENERGY THROUGH FUSION.

* **ACCRETION TRIGGERS THE EXPLOSION:**  THE WHITE DWARF ACCRETES (PULLS IN) MATTER FROM A COMPANION STAR. WHEN THE MASS OF THE WHITE DWARF EXCEEDS A CRITICAL LIMIT (THE CHANDRASEKHAR LIMIT), IT CAN NO LONGER SUPPORT ITSELF AGAINST GRAVITY.

* **DEFLAGRATION OR DETONATION:** THE RUNAWAY NUCLEAR FUSION THAT OCCURS IN A TYPE IA SUPERNOVA IS EITHER A DEFLAGRATION (A SLOW-BURNING WAVE) OR A DETONATION (A RAPID EXPLOSION). 

* **CONSISTENT PEAK LUMINOSITY:**  TYPE IA SUPERNOVAE HAVE REMARKABLY CONSISTENT PEAK LUMINOSITIES, REGARDLESS OF THEIR DISTANCE. THIS MAKES THEM EXCELLENT ""STANDARD CANDLES"" FOR MEASURING COSMIC DISTANCES.

* **COSMOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE:** THE STUDY OF TYPE IA SUPERNOVAE HAS PLAYED A CRUCIAL ROLE IN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE ACCELERATING EXPANSION OF THE UNIVERSE.

Q: How did the lunar maria form?
A) The giant impact that created the Moon left smooth areas that we call the maria.
B) Volatiles escaping from the Moon's interior heated and eroded the surface in the regions of the maria.
C) The early bombardment created heat that melted the lunar surface in the regions of the maria.
D) Large impacts fractured the Moon's lithosphere allowing lava to fill the impact basins.
